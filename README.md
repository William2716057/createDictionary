# Dictionary Creator

Dictionary Creator is a Python script that extracts words from a given file, removes punctuation except for '!' and '*', and creates a dictionary of unique words.

## How it Works

The script reads a text file specified by the user, tokenizes the words, removes punctuation except for '!' and '*', converts the words to lowercase, and then writes the extracted words into a file named 'dictionary.txt'.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/William2716057/createDictionary

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd dictionary-creator

3. Run the script:

python createDictionary.py

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing the `createDictionary.py` file.
2. Enter the path to the file from which you want to extract words when prompted.
3. Once the script finishes execution, the dictionary will be created as 'dictionary.txt' in the project directory.
